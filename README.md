## Project presentation

I realized this project in the context of a project at [IUT Lyon 1](https://iut.univ-lyon1.fr/) in the second year of study.
This is an interactive and customizable game that implements a maze generation algorithm, inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7vaT8bZRuk), which I made myself.
It is possible to play with a maze ranging from 7 to 201 in length/width and solve it by yourself or using solving tools.
